# MinetopiaCollectibles
The goal of minetopia collectibles is to put the collectibles in different places in a fun way. 
The player is thus able to visualize his 'goals' by placing them somewhere in a nice place.

## Does the plugin use anything?
The plugin uses DDG's texture pack.
This is a minecraft server with a Rolplay game mode minetopia that requires a texture pack.
In this game mode you have the opportunity to get different rewards, and we want to visualize these.
